It&amp;rsquo;s when I ran into an interesting issue that the StackOverflow didn&amp;rsquo;t offer the usual obvious answer. After some digging, I&amp;rsquo;m finally sharing my solution it here.
The problem was that sometimes traces produced by two services didn&amp;rsquo;t get glued together by the Datadog backend. It appeared that APM traces with calls between &amp;ldquo;Service A&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Service B&amp;rdquo; were correlated, but the same stitching didn&amp;rsquo;t work when &amp;ldquo;Service B&amp;rdquo; made a call to &amp;ldquo;Service A&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
