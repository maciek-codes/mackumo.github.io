title: Getting started
---
Hi, I am Maciej and I am about to graduate with a Computer Science degree soon. I thought it's a shame that I still don't have a website, isn't it? Therefore I decided to be a cool kid and to start my own website and a blog.

I discovered this cool Jekyll-like node.js static site generator called [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) - seems to meet my needs for now. Next step will be to build a layout, but I have to admit I am not a designer at all.

I want to write about mostly some tech content and maybe share a few things I built or what I learnt. Too many times I discovered something cool and thought to myself 'oh I should blog about it!' but never actually did. So now I have a blog and there won't be any more excuses.

In the meantime, follow can me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/macqm) and [Github](http://github.com/macqm).
